# @brief The Notifications module handles warning and error notifications that
# some components might need to throw.
#
#  The mechanism allows KTiny components to be loosely coupled with whatever
#  the application programmer wants to do in these cases.
#  The error and warning handlers should be registered:
#
# \code
#  def error(title, message, detail):
#	print "ERROR: Title: %s, Message: %s, Detail: %s" % (title, message, detail)
#  def warning(title, message):
#	print "WARNING: Title: %s, Message: %s, Detail: %s" % (title, message, detail)
#
#  Notifications.errorHandler = error
#  Notifications.warningHandler = warning
# \endcode
#
#  This will make that any component that needs to notify an error using
#  Notifications.notifyError(), the error() function will be called. The same
#  for warnings.
#
#  If no handler is specified the notification will be ignored. The KTiny
#  application uses a special form for errors and a message box for warnings.

errorHandler = None
warningHandler = None
concurrencyErrorHandler = None
lostConnectionErrorHandler = None
